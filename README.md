# webFTP
Small and pretty horrible web ftp client written in PHP

It supports download, upload and delete operations and can navigate through subfolders.
Just login and the / path of the ftp with its contents will be on the screen.

Server credentials are kept in the session cache, files uploaded and downloaded
are temporarily stored on the server.

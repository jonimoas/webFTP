# webFTP
Small and pretty horrible web ftp client written entirely in PHP with no extra dependencies

It supports download, upload and delete operations and can navigate through subfolders.
Just login and the / path of the ftp with its contents will be on the screen.

Server credentials are kept in the session cache, files uploaded and downloaded
are temporarily stored on the server.
